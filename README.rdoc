= Enveloper

This project rocks and uses MIT-LICENSE.
A small engine that allows you to see how your site looks at small window sizes without resizing the browser window.

= Usage

Mount engine in routes.rb of your progect. Like
    mount Enveloper::Engine => "/enveloper"

Then go to /enveloper and type the url you'd like to see in the address bar as a hash. As a fallback "open in new window" button rises new window of selected size.

It uses jquery cookie plugin ( https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie ) to keep selected size.

Also enveloper could be used as a set of static files. You can take them from gh-pages branch of this project.
You can test the script at http://dafa.github.com/enveloper/.
